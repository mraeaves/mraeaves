# Heyy, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am presently engaged in the process of revitalizing a former college e-commerce project known as '<a href="https://github.com/mraeaves/techoutlet">TechOutlet</a>'. The objective of this initiative is to develop a responsive and semi-functional website that facilitates product filtering, user login, and the display of a dashboard page, which will be a new feature added to the project.
- ðŸŒ± I am in the process of enhancing my expertise in Python and web application development, while also delving into the React JS library, which I am applying in my ongoing projects.
- ðŸ†• I possess a strong enthusiasm for acquiring new knowledge, and I have recently focused my attention on expanding my understanding of custom software development and the creation of bespoke applications that can operate on various devices, including Raspberry Pi.
