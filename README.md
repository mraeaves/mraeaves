# Heyy, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on revamping an old college e-commerce store project called '<a href="https://github.com/mraeaves/techoutlet">TechOutlet</a>'. My aim with this is to make the site responsive and semi-functional where the site works with filtering products, logging into the site, allowing the view of a dashboard page (this will be a new addition to the project)
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently expanding my knowledge with web app development and I am currently exploring the React JS library, using this in my current new projects.
